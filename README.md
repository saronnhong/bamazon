## Overview
BAmazon is an Amazon-like storefront. The Customer app takes orders from the customers and depletes the stock from inventory. The Manger app is able to view the products that are available for sale, check items that are low in inventory, add to the inventory, and add new products to the store front. The Supervisor app is able to keep track of the sales and profit for each department and be able to add new departments.

## Usage
The BAmazon app runs in the Terminal window. User must install the Inquirer, MySQL, and Console Table NPM packages before being able to run the application. User must type "node bamazonCustomer.js", "node bamazonManager.js", or "node bamazonSupervisor" to start one of the applications. User will then be prompted on what they would like to do.
